### Project task

Create a landing page similar to the provided [example](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png). This project is the second assignment of The Odin Project curriculum.

### Learning goal

Understanding the box model and using flexbox.

### Outcomes

Instead of following the example pixel by pixel, I attempted to give it my own spin by creating a landing page for an imaginary art website. Font, color palette and images were individually selected by me to fit the concept I was going for. I also added media queries to make the design responsive as possible.
